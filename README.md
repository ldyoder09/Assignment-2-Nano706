# Assignment-2-Nano706  
Part 1- From this part of the homework assignment, I was able to apply the examples given in lecture to do a diagram tree based on the wine dataset. Just by applying the data from the wine data to the code that was shown in class. I also was able to do a linear regression analysis the same way by just using the wine data given to apply to the code that was shown in lecture. I also found that my SVM model to be 1.00 which is completely accurate.

Part 2- Personally, I found this part of the homework the most interesting due to applying the code to my personal images. I loved how it was able to identify my dog that is also in the image, I thought that was neat. Also, in this part my linear regression accuracy was 91.56% accurate. I believe that to be pretty accurate. Overall, I found this assignment to be very interesting, even though I find coding challenging. Doing these exercises makes me want to find ways to apply to my research.
